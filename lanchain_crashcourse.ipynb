He is known for his leadership of Tesla, SpaceX, X (formerly Twitter), and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk has been considered the wealthiest person in the world since 2021; as of May 2025, Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$424.7 billion. \n",
      "Born to a wealthy family in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk emigrated in 1989 to Canada. He received bachelor's degrees from the University of Pennsylvania in 1997 before moving to California, United States, to pursue business ventures. In 1995, Musk co-founded the software company Zip2. Following its sale in 1999, he co-founded X.com, an online payment company that later merged to form PayPal, which was acquired by eBay in 2002. That year, Musk also became an American citizen.\n",
      "In 2002, Musk founded the space technology company SpaceX, becoming its CEO and chief engineer; the company has since led innovations in reusable rockets and commercial spaceflight. Musk joined the automaker Tesla as an early investor in 2004 and became its CEO and product architect in 2008; it has since become a leader in electric vehicles. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI to advance artificial intelligence (AI) research but later left; growing discontent with the organization's direction and their leadership in the AI boom in the 2020s led him to establish xAI. In 2022, he acquired the social network Twitter, implementing significant changes and rebranding it as X in 2023. His other businesses include the neurotechnology company Neuralink, which he co-founded in 2016, and the tunneling company the Boring Company, which he founded in 2017.\n",
      "Musk was the largest donor in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, and is a supporter of global far-right figures, causes, and political parties.  In early 2025, he served as senior advisor to United States president Donald Trump and as the de facto head of DOGE. After a public feud with Trump, Musk left the Trump administration and announced he was creating his own political party, the America Party.\n",
      "Musk's political activities, views, and statements have made him a polarizing figure, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation and promoting conspiracy theories, and affirming antisemitic, racist, and transphobic comments. His acquisition of Twitter was controversial due to a subsequent increase in hate speech and the spread of misinformation on the service. His role in the second Trump administration attracted public backlash, particularly in response to DOGE.\n",

      "Page: Trump–Musk feud\n",
      "Summary: In June and July 2025, businessman and former presidential advisor Elon Musk and U.S. President Donald Trump engaged in a series of social media attacks, primarily across X (formerly Twitter) and Truth Social, following Musk's exit from the second Trump administration with his criticisms of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a bill intended to be landmark legislation for Trump.\n",
      "Prior to being political allies in 2024, Musk and Trump shared a history of mutual provocation. In 2022, Musk described Trump as an unsuitable president due to his age in response to Trump calling him a \"bullshit artist\".\n",

      "Page: Wealth of Elon Musk\n",
      "Summary: Elon Musk is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$381 billion as of May 2025, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $424.7 billion according to Forbes, primarily from his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX. \n",
      "Having been first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, around 75% of Musk's wealth was derived from Tesla stock in November 2020. Describing himself as \"cash poor\", he became the first person in the world to have a net worth above $300 billion a year later. By December 2024, he became the first person to reach a net worth of $400 billion.\n",
